# My first clone of Netflix Website

## full of terror and horror movies, animes and documentaries

- The first step was to create the main banner for the movie, I chose The Blair Witch Project as the theme for the website. Then we started building the slider with films. In the beginning, the teacher only taught how to make one slider and I chose to create three, one with movies, one with anime and another with documentaries. In the footer I put my name with an anchor for my linkedin.
